This project will use the [OneFlow](https://www.endoflineblog.com/oneflow-a-git-branching-model-and-workflow) develop + master model of releasing:

The develop branch is the main branch. Whenever there is particularly noteworthy snapshot, then I will tag it fast forward the "master" branch to the latest release tag.

If you want the "latest" then stick to the develop branch. If you want the latest "stable" that I've tested for deployment, use the Master branch.
