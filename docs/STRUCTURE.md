# Project Structure

There are dozens of ways to skin a Svelte site...and I consistently re-organize, but my primary goal is to organize items by function, and so that it's relatively easy to find all your scripts by general function

## `/Docs`

Where all Documents (except the main [README](../readme.md)) shall go. README will stay in the root as per convention.

## `/public`

This is where most of Svelte's autogenerated 'bundles' go (compiled js & css files). That said, there are a few files you may wish to customize:

- `index.html`: All content Svelte compiles will be inserted INTO this index.html file (in the body section). So, some immutable `<head>` elements are best set here. If you want to set and forget some global css styles, then this is where you'd link them.
- `/css` This is probably the best place to put your 'global' css files. Several are already in place:

  - `normalize.css` attempts to 'reset' all browsers so their default styling behaviors are as similar as possible.
  - `color.css` is where I've defined light mode and dark mode `:root` colors. Edit these colors as you see fit.
  - `global.css` is where I've set very broad global styles (like body color, margin, padding etc).
  - `svg.css` mostly not used (but will contain custom svgs)

  - `/fa` font-awesome

- `/images` This is where you'll want to place most, if not all, of your images. When linking to images, imagine that the `/public` folder will be the root of your site (because IT will be). SO if you want to link to an image inside the `images` folder inside public, do it like this:

  ```
  <img src="/images/YOURIMAGE.jpg" />
  ```

  points to: `/public/images/YOURIMAGE.jpg`.

## `/src`

This is the main folder you'll be working in most of the time. This is where ALL the Svelte source files live.
